// scratchFileWarning builds a completion-time warning listing brand-new files
// the model created during this run (via write_file) that are still sitting in
// the workspace, untracked by git, when the run ends. This is the safest fix
// for https://github.com/Gitlawb/zero/issues/551 — Zero never guesses which
// files are "scratch" and deletes them (a wrong guess would destroy real
// work), it just surfaces what git would otherwise silently let `git add -A`
// sweep up, so a leftover `_debug.py` is caught before it is committed instead
// of after.
//
// Returns "" when there is nothing to report: no files were created, git is
// unavailable, workspaceRoot isn't a git repo, or every created file was
// either removed again or already tracked/staged by the model itself.
